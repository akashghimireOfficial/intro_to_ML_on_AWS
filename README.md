# Introduction to Machine Learning on AWS
This github repository contains exercise and other necessary information to complete the course [Intro to Machine Learning on AWS course from coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-on-aws). 

In this course we will learn how to utilize AWS services such as ``Amazon S3, AWS Rekognition, Amazon Comprehend, Amazon SageMaker``. I will be making notes on each of these services so anyone who goes through this repository would have a good understanding of above services. 

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform by Amazon. It is one of the widely adopted cloud platform.  It provides a a broad set of on-demand services including machine learning. In this course we will also focus on aws machine learning related services. 




## Prerequisite (NOT INCLUDED IN THE TURTORIAL)


In this course, we will be using `Python Programming Language`, and thus we will use `Boto3`, which is the AWS Software Developmemt Kit (SDK) for python. Boto3 allows Python develper to use AWS services. 

> SDK is a collection of software tools, libraries, documentation, code samples, and other resources that developers use to create applications for specific platforms or environments.


To install `boto3` run the following scripts:
```bash
pip install boto3
```
If you are not familiar with boto3, and using services using ``boto3``, you can look at basic turtorial for boto3 services (`s3`,`rekognition`,...) in this folder
