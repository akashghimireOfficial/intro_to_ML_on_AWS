# Introduction to Machine Learning on AWS
This github repository contains exercise and other necessary information to complete the course [Intro to Machine Learning on AWS course from coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-on-aws). 

In this course we will learn how to utilize AWS services such as ``Amazon S3, AWS Rekognition, Amazon Comprehend, Amazon SageMaker``. I will be making notes on each of these services so anyone who goes through this repository would have a good understanding of above services. 

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform by Amazon. It is one of the widely adopted cloud platform.  It provides a a broad set of on-demand services including machine learning. In this course we will also focus on aws machine learning related services. 

In this course, we will be using `Python Programming Language`, and thus we will use `Boto3`, which is the AWS Software Developmemt Kit (SDK) for python. Boto3 allows Python develper to use AWS services. To install `boto3` run the following scripts:
